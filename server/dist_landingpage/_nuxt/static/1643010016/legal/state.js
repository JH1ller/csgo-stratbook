If you have a Github account, you can open an issue on the projects repository. You can also always send me a DM on twitter."},{id:"who-can-see",questionText:"Who can see my strats?",answerText:"Your strats are only visible to your own team. Stratbook has good security measures in place to keep your strats safe and sound."},{id:"costs",questionText:"Are there any costs or prices?",answerText:"Stratbook is so called \"Free and Open Source Software\". Using the code and hosting the service yourself will always be free.\u003Cbr\u003EThe prehosted service at \"app.stratbook.live\" is also currently free. I'm not planning to make a profit from this, so there only might be a light monetization at a later stage to cover hosting and domain costs."},{id:"server-down",questionText:"What if Stratbook servers are down?",answerText:"Stratbook is hosted on Amazon Web Services, so downtimes are extremely unlikely. I'm working on implementing PWA (Progressive Web App) Support, which allows you to install Stratbook locally and even use it offline without internet. Strats and nades are then updated once you have a connection again."},{id:"self-host",questionText:"Can I host Stratbook myself?",answerText:"You can absolutely host Stratbook yourself. There is a guide on setting it up and installing prerequesites on the Github page of the project, which will be continuously improved."},{id:"whos-behind",questionText:"Who is behind this project?",answerText:"Hi there! I'm Justin, a 25 year old web engineer & esports enthusiast based in Stuttgart, Germany. I played CSGO in the german amateur scene for a few years and started developing Stratbook in my freetime during Covid-19.\u003Cbr\u003ESince the start of 2021, my friend and fellow developer Clemens has also joined the project and has already made great efforts with rethinking our architecture.\u003Cbr\u003EBut you, too, could be behind this project!
