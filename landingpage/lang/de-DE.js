If you have a Github account, you can open an issue on the projects repository. You can also always send me a DM on twitter.",

Using the code and hosting the service yourself will always be free.<br>The prehosted service at "app.stratbook.live" is also currently free.

I played CSGO in the german amateur scene for a few years and started developing Stratbook in my freetime during Covid-19.<br>Since the start of 2021, my friend and fellow developer Clemens has also joined the project and has already made great efforts with rethinking our architecture.<br>But you, too, could be behind this project!
